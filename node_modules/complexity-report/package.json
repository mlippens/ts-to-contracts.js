`:)`\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe build environment relies on\n[Node.js][node],\n[NPM],\n[Jake],\n[JSHint],\n[Mocha] and\n[Chai].\nAssuming that you already have Node.js and NPM set up,\nyou just need to run `npm install`\nto install all of the dependencies\nas listed in `package.json`.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tests are in `test/complexityReport.js`. You can run them with the\ncommand `npm test` or `jake test`.\n\n[ci-image]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/philbooth/complexityReport.js.png?branch=master\n[ci-status]: http://travis-ci.org/#!/philbooth/complexityReport.js\n[esprima]: http://esprima.org/\n[jscomplexity]: http://jscomplexity.org/\n[gleb]: https://github.com/bahmutov\n[js-complexity-viz]: https://github.com/bahmutov/js-complexity-viz\n[jarrod]: http://jarrodoverson.com/blog/about\n[plato]: https://github.com/jsoverson/plato\n[tracker]: https://github.com/philbooth/complexityReport.js/issues\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[npm]: https://npmjs.org/\n[jake]: https://github.com/mde/jake\n[jshint]: https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint\n[mocha]: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha\n[chai]: http://chaijs.com/\n\n",
